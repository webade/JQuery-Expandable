JQuery Expandable
=================

This plugin will crop a paragraph of text and add a link to show/hide the rest of the content.

Usage:

$('#element').expandable({
	moreText: 'more text' //The value for the more text link
	lessText: 'less text' //The value for the less text link
	words: 40 //The number of words to crop the text by
 });

 TODO
 ====


Make it work for a div container with multiple paragraphs, and not just a single paragraph.
